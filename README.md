Simple ZSH Theme with Line-Separated Prompts

Based on [Robby Russell's theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/robbyrussell.zsh-theme).
Only difference is the addition of yellow line separators befor each new prompt, making it easy to spot new prompt while scrolling along.
